# 🔫 3D Shooting Game AI Prototype

This is a 3D first-person shooting game prototype designed and built using Gemini (AI-powered Game Builder). It demonstrates my understanding of game logic, AI behavior, difficulty scaling, and health/ammo systems.

## 🎮 Features

- AI friend/companion that follows and supports the player.
- Wave-based enemy system (difficulty increases as waves progress).
- Health bar tracking player damage.
- Automatic ammo reload when empty.
- Weapon switching between different rifles (high damage, rapid fire).

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- Gemini Game Engine (AI-powered)
- Prompt engineering with ChatGPT
